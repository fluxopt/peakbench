"""Peak-memory measurement via ``memray`` — the core pytest-benchmem engine.

:func:`measure_memory` runs one action under a ``memray.Tracker`` and returns a
:class:`MemoryResult`: the peak in **bytes** (the source unit memray reports —
storing the raw integer is lossless and lets the display layer auto-scale
B/KiB/MiB/GiB), the worst peak across repeats, and the allocation count.
:func:`measure_peak` is the bare one-liner that returns just the peak bytes::

    from pytest_benchmem import measure_peak, measure_memory

    peak = measure_peak(lambda: build_model(1000))          # int bytes
    res = measure_memory(lambda: build_model(1000), repeats=5)
    res.peak_bytes, res.allocations, res.total_bytes        # mirror `memray stats`

Two measurement modes (``measure_memory(..., mode=...)``):

- ``heap`` (default) — memray allocator demand, in-process. Byte-exact, Python-only;
  the right tool for "where does my allocation peak". memray's ``peak_memory`` tracks
  the allocator directly, so unlike sampled RSS it doesn't miss the numpy/C detail or
  fold in interpreter baseline.
- ``rss`` — kernel resident high-water (``ru_maxrss``) of the workload run in a forked
  child. Page-granular and includes the runtime, but it's the uniform, language-agnostic
  *capacity* number, and — being a kernel high-water, not sampled — it can't miss a spike
  the way a polling sampler (ASV ``peakmem``, psutil) does. See :func:`_measure_rss`.
